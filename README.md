# Balanced-Annihilation-Weblobby-Installer
A Weblobby derivative and the associated (Windows) installer for BA

To build the React component (which is basically all the main application logic and GUI), you need node installed. To build, go to weblobby/swl-website and run "npm run build"

To build the installer, you need to have InnoInstaller, http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php To build, open setup.iss and click the green "Run" arrow button in the top bar.

Currently, this installs Weblobby and associated shortcuts that can be used to start it. No custom graphcis in yet. Some custom settings are in, such as Weblobby only showing BA games.
