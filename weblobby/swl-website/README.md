Development
===========

If you're using Windows, remember that you need to log out and back in for PATH
changes to take effect.

* Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/), it provides the npm utility.
* Open the console, cd to the project directory and run <code>npm install</code>
to install dependencies.
* Run <code>npm run watch</code>. This starts the watch server at
http://localhost:8080, open it in your browser. When you make changes to the
source files, everything is recompiled and the browser window is refreshed automatically.
* You can use <code>npm run build</code> for a one-off debug build.
